        &emsp; The synagogue of Dura-Europos as it was at the time of the city’s
        destruction can be dated to around 244-245 CE.{supConstructor(1)} It is
        part of a mainly residential city block and is composed of three main
        parts: the dwelling (“House H”), a fore-court, and the House of
        Assembly.
        {supConstructor(2)} An earlier synagogue occupied the space of what
        became the fore-court and house of assembly of the synagogue as it was
        at the time of Dura’s destruction.{supConstructor(3)} This earlier
        synagogue was adapted from a private house and consisted of a series of
        chambers grouped around a courtyard; there was a diwan, an aedicula to
        house scripture, an assembly room, potentially a room specifically for
        female worshippers, and painted wall and ceiling decorations.
        {supConstructor(4)}
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp; The entire complex (House H, fore-court, House of Assembly) of
        the later synagogue can only be accessed through the entrance to House
        H.{supConstructor(5)} House H consisted of a diwan and a group of rooms
        that seem to have had a residential function.{supConstructor(6)}{" "}
        Kraeling, in the Final Report, hypothesized that these rooms were used
        as a guest-house for visiting Jewish travelers.{supConstructor(7)} The
        fore-court was probably used as a community space for the instruction of
        children, scholarly discussions, and there was a basin for washing hands
        before entering the House of Assembly for prayer.{supConstructor(8)}
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp; What makes the synagogue of Dura-Europos unique is that its House
        of Assembly is covered with painted wall-frescoes depicting Biblical
        scenes.{supConstructor(9)} This forced scholars to rethink the previous
        assumption that the second commandment resulted in the absence of any
        “Jewish art.”{supConstructor(10)} In doing so, there has been fierce
        debate about how to interpret the paintings. Some have concluded that
        the Jewish community at Dura-Europos was unorthodox, others have viewed
        the frescoes as a forerunner of Christian art, or as drawing from a
        history of now-lost Hellenistic illustrated manuscripts.
        {supConstructor(11)} There has also been significant debate about how to
        relate the paintings to textual sources or the extent to which they were
        either similar to other art at Dura-Europos or a conscious effort to
        distance the Jewish community from “pagan” norms.{supConstructor(12)}
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp; In addition to the paintings, the House of Assembly contained an
        aedicula to display scripture and painted ceiling tiles. The ceiling
        tiles were painted with animals, flowers, and astrological symbols.
        {supConstructor(13)} Some were inscribed with the names of founders and
        donors.
        {supConstructor(14)} Other textual evidence demonstrates that the Jewish
        community at Dura-Europos was multilingual: a fragment of a Hebrew
        prayer was found near the synagogue and one or the wall paintings was
        labeled in Hebrew, but most of the inscriptions and graffiti are in
        Aramaic and Greek. There are also some long Persian inscriptions on the
        wall paintings.{supConstructor(15)}

      <p>
        &emsp; Atargatis is a Syrian goddess who may have been the patron saint
        of Dura-Europos (or the patron saint may have been Nike or Artemis).
        {supConstructor(16)} Based on inscriptions, the Temple of Atargatis was
        first built between 31-92 CE.{supConstructor(17)} Seleucid (312-63 BCE)
        coins found throughout the temple may attest to the fact that the site
        was already important at that time. {supConstructor(18)}
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp; The temple’s main entrance, on either side of which are two
        little exterior chapels, leads to a room of tiered benches, then the
        naos of the temple, before opening up to a great court which is
        surrounded by more little chambers.{supConstructor(19)} The naos (the
        inner chamber of the temple) contained a pedestal supporting a statue of
        Atargatis and two little rooms for sacred objects.{supConstructor(20)}{" "}
        The great court, constructed of baked brick, contained a main
        sacrificial altar, as well as a basin in the center.{supConstructor(21)}{" "}
        There is evidence that the edifice of the temple was quickly repaired
        with brick and plaster after the earthquake of 160 CE.
        {supConstructor(22)} A staircase led to the roof of the temple.
        {supConstructor(23)}
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp; It may be that “the cultus statue of Atargatis was brought forth
        from the naos into the [room with tiered benches] and there worshiped
        with dancing and orgiastic rites by the priests to the accompaniment of
        music from the worshipers.”{supConstructor(24)} The temples of Artemis
        and of the Palmyrene Gods at Dura-Europos possess similar plans and may
        therefore have had similar ceremonial rituals.{supConstructor(25)}
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp; In addition to the great sacrificial altars, the temple also
        contained a smaller altar probably dedicated to the god Hadad - the
        partner of Atargatis - as well as two little altars to the gods Sasados
        and Saddoudan.{supConstructor(26)} Important finds from the Temple of
        Atargatis include a bas-relief of the goddess with Hadad at her side,
        {supConstructor(27)} a cuneiform tablet re-used as a brick that contains
        evidence for an older version of the place name “Dura” (“Da-wa-ra”),
        {supConstructor(28)} a rare inscription at Dura-Europos in Hatrene,
        {supConstructor(29)} and one of only few portrait sculptures found at
        Dura - a life-sized female statue in the room with tiered benches.

            <p>&emsp;
            The Palmyrene Gate, known as Bab al-Hawa by locals, is a monumental structure on the west of Dura-Europos. The earliest known photograph of Dura-Europos was taken in 1885 by John Henry Hayes, American Consul to Baghdad, of the Palmyrene Gate.{supConstructor(31)} It was one of the first structures to be excavated in the first season, with excavation completed in the second season, and some additional finds occurring later.{supConstructor(32)} These initial seasons were, as Baird notes, heavily militarized; the Syrian legion excavated the gate in spring 1928{supConstructor(33)} and a commander of the Syrian legion supervised excavation work on the Palmyrene gate in the 1929 season.{supConstructor(34)}
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;
            We now know that the Palmyrene gate and other fortifications of the city date to the mid-second century BC.{supConstructor(35)} The Palmyrene Gate was the primary gate of the western wall.{supConstructor(36)} It led to the route along the west bank of the Euphrates to northern and western Syria and Palmyra.{supConstructor(37)} However, no clearly defined road between these two cities has been established.{supConstructor(38)} Inside the city, the gate leads to the main street of Dura-Europos.{supConstructor(39)}
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;
            The gate itself consists of two towers on either side of a passageway. The upper stories of the towers are not directly connected to the ground floor and only accessible by ladder.{supConstructor(40)} The rooms on the ground floor of the gate were probably only used for storage.{supConstructor(41)} This is similar to other parts of Dura-Europos’ fortifications, suggesting defense was concentrated in the upper stories.{supConstructor(42)} Some of the structure is constructed of unbaked bricks and rubble, which the excavators claimed pointed to the hasty reconstruction of the gate after an earthquake in 160 CE.{supConstructor(43)}
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;
            The city walls north and south of the gate do not perfectly align; von Gerkan hypothesized that the first gate at the site therefore incorporated a tight, bended passage to create a further obstacle for an enemy entering the city.{supConstructor(44)} Inside the passageway of the gate, there are three doors getting increasingly broader as one enters the city.{supConstructor(45)} There may have been a small sanctuary to the Fortune (Tyche) of Dura within the gate, as evidenced by a number of inscriptions and some roadside altars.{supConstructor(46)} 
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;
            It was already evident in the first season of excavations that the gate was particularly rich with inscriptions.{supConstructor(47)} The inscriptions point to the cultural diversity of Dura-Europos’ inhabitants. While most are in Greek, there are also inscriptions in Latin, Palmyrene, and Safaitic (Arabic in non-Arabic script).{supConstructor(48)} One inscription with the name of the goddess Nemesis (for whom there is also a bas-relief at the gate) was the first such inscription found in a “Semitic” context at the time of excavation.{supConstructor(49)} The plethora of inscriptions - many of which simply contain names - has allowed Johnson to reconstruct the family trees of some Durene families.{supConstructor(50)} The many names of military personnel inscribed into the gate also point to a significant military presence.{supConstructor(51)}
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;
            Other finds from the Palmyrene gate and its immediate vicinity include a bronze swastika,{supConstructor(52)} a hoard of 818 coins and assorted jewelry,{supConstructor(53)} two laurel or olive crowns,{supConstructor(54)} two panels of painted wood,{supConstructor(55)} a basalt mill,{supConstructor(56)} textiles and leather from soldiers’ boots,{supConstructor(57)} and a loan document recorded on parchment.{supConstructor(58)}

const mithraeumDescription = () => {
    return(
        <div>
            <p>&emsp;
            The Mithraeum is located in the northwestern part of Dura-Europos in block J7, next to a city gate.{supConstructor(59)} Unlike Mithraea in other parts of the Roman empire, the one in Dura-Europos is unique as it is above and not below ground.{supConstructor(60)} It is one of the most “complete” Mithraea and contains reliefs, frescoes, architecture preserved to ceiling height, and over two hundred graffiti and dipinti. Like the synagogue, this material was preserved by the embankment built over it to buttress the city wall against attack.{supConstructor(61)} 
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;
            Scholars disagree on the evolution of the Mithraeum. The earliest dated inscriptions in the building are preserved in the two paintings of Mithras slaying the bull. One is dated to 168 CE and one to 171/2 CE.{supConstructor(62)} Early scholars such as Cumont, and later ones such as Gnoli, date the “first phase” of the Mithraeum to those dedication dates, with a second phase during which the building was restored during the period of the Severan dynasty (r. 193-235) and a third phase lasting until it was buried beneath the embankment in 256 CE.{supConstructor(63)} Gnoli argues that in this second phase, the Mithraeum substantially increased in size, corresponding to an intensified Roman presence at Dura-Europos.{supConstructor(64)} However, Dirven and McCarty dispute this and note that the Mithraeum structure at the time of Dura’s destruction aligned well with older foundations; therefore, the original Mithraeum was not simply inserted into part of a private residence. They argue that there are two distinct structural phases of the Mithraeum.  
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;
            It is clear that the Mithraeum had a strong association with the Roman military; inscriptions demonstrate that many of the worshippers were members of the twentieth Palmyrene cohort. Additionally, the floor of the Mithraeum is laid with bricks fired according to the standards of the Roman military. However, it is unclear how the Mithraic community at Dura-Europos originated, given no cult of Mithras is attested at Palmyra and the style of the paintings in the Mithraeum share features with other local Durene art. 
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;
            The inside of the Mithraeum is decorated with two scenes of Mithras slaying the bull (tauroctony) and thirteen scenes of Mithras’ life and cosmological events, including vivid hunting scenes. Under the arched niche, there was a further tauroctony and depictions of the twelve signs of the zodiac. The walls are lined with benches for the members of the cult. There has been much debate about the extent to which these paintings deviated (or did not) from “orthodoxy” and practices in other parts of the Roman Empire. For example, Gnoli argues that the Mithraeum at Dura shows its Iranian origin. Cumont and Rostovtzeff posited an original “eastern” context for the Mithraeum being updated over time to fit Western “orthodoxy.” Dirven and McCarty, however, argue that two layers of paintings at the Mithraeum suggest continuity rather than change and that it is difficult to detect significant departures from an “orthodoxy” which is poorly defined.
